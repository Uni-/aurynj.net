- Made an on-demand assets system for Mabinogi MoL (launched for Android: Jan 2013), integrated with the Unity Editor (Mabinogi MoL was made on Unity 4). It resulted in major reduction of the base app artifact size from ~ 180 MB to &lt; 30 MB, then also enabling service launch for iOS later (Nov 2013). It took 2 wks to make an early days implementation.
